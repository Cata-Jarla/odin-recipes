     <h2>Description</h2>

     <p>Sarmale is a beloved traditional dish across Eastern Europe and the Balkans, especially famous in Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey. Each country has its own version, but the essence remains the same: <strong>minced meat and rice wrapped in cabbage or vine leaves</strong>, simmered slowly in a rich tomato-based sauce.</p>

     <p><strong><em>Sarmale - Romanian Cultural Background</em></strong>
    - Sarmale is a national dish of Romania, especially <strong><em>Christmas, Easter and weddings</em></strong>. It originates from Ottoman Empire, which influenced the romanian cuisine during centuries of interaction. Romanians adopted the dish by using pickled cabbage instead of vine leaves and adding smoked meats and spices for deeper flavor. </p>
