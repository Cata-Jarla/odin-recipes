     <h2>Description</h2>

     <p>Gulas is a hearty, flavorful stew or soup that originates from <strong>Hungary</strong>, but it's also beloved across Central and Eastern Eurpe, including <strong>Romania, Slovakia, Austria and Serbia</strong>. It's especially known for its rich paprika-flavored broth and tender chunks of meat.</p>

     <p><strong><em>Cultural Background of Gulas</em></strong>- The word <strong>gulyas</strong> in Hungarian means <strong>"herdsman"</strong> - the dish was traditionally cooked by cattle herders over open fires in the Great Hungarin Plain. It started as a simple soup made with meat, onions, and paprika. Over time, it evolved into different regional styles: thick stews, soups or even versions with dumplings or pasta. </p>
